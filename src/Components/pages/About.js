      <p>Welcome to the game of Wizard Chess. Wizard Chess is similar to the normal game of chess but 
        with radical additions to normal gameplay. Gameplay will include classes in the form of new starting formation, 
        items in the game to turn the tides in your favor, and even the ability to combine pieces for new ways to attack the opponent.
         With more ways to win besides checkmate, Wizard chess feels like an entirely different game. Wizards ages 10+</p>
      <p>The goal of Wizard Chess is to make a chess a more fun, easily accesible game for everyone, especially new players. We think that by adding fun components such as customizable skins for pieces and boards
        will make the game a lot more visually appealing. To make the game itself more exciting we will add a ton of cool features, such as abilities the players can use on a cooldown basis, power-ups
        scattered across the board, an ever expanding board, and more!
