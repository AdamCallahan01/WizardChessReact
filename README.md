Project for CS378 by Adam and Austin.

Built using react and hosted on AWS Amplify

Our idea for this project is to make a version of chess that is much more appealling to a young audience. We have a lot of fun features we want to add to the base game of chess, such as combining pieces, adding different starting layouts for the player to choose from in the form of classes, and player controlled abilities.
We also want to change the typical way that chess is played. Our main ideas for this are adding alternative ways for players to win, and to change the shape/size of the board during the game.
